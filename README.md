FAQ:

1. Who are we?
Student startup based in Prague, Czech Republic. We have not set up any legal entity yet to represent the project. This campaign is to spread the awareness of this new idea to see whether we can find big enough community that would like to use it.

2. Do you have pro-gamers? 
Pro-gamers have not confirmed their interest yet. We have contacted all the pro-gaming teams in order to inform them about this fan project. The more you help us spread the word the better chance pros will acknowledge it. 

3. Who qualifies as a pro-gamer?
All pro-gamers must be verified accounts on DOTABUFF: http://www.dotabuff.com/players/verified. There is also a possibility to include players with the highest MMR if there is enough of interest - they could couch the amateur players.

4. For whom is this app?
Casual, fan gamers that would be willing to pay to play with their idols. Gamers like ourselves.

5. How does it work? From both perspectives (fan & pro-gamer).
Users login into the app using their Steam account (Steam is external login provider - the same process as on DOTABUFF). Immediately after login we are able to distinguish whether the gamer is pro or amateur.

The process: pros set their own price & game type (1v1, lobby, public AP, any game type etc.) and they set their status to "online". Now amateurs can send the invitation to play. If the invitation is accepted amateur is promted to pay through PayPal. After he paid he receives unique code & creates a Dota2 chat room using the code. Pro-gamer can see the code and joins the chat room. Now both parties can join a party and start the game.

This process has advantages that there is no need to become friends on Steam or use Skype or any other communication method. 

After the match is finished we check whether amateur SteamID & pro SteamID were playing together. If everything went well we finish the transaction. In case of problems we check the game replay and there is a possibility to refund the money.

Another functionality would the possibility for pros to make available dates & times to book. In case of huge demand we could implement auctions.

6. Why would pro-gamers do it?
This project is based upon assumption that this would be great opportunity for pro-gamers to get a new income stream. Imagine that they would get paid by a fan to play & they could stream the game. We believe that it would be fun content to watch on stream. Some fans would be happy to play with pros, pros would be happy for new income and there could be new fun game type to watch on streams (pro-amateur combo).

The only question is how many players like us there are. Players who admire pros and would be willing to pay to play with them.

7. What is the vision?
To find the community like us and create a great product that suites our wants (adding functionality and modifying the app) & get the interest from pro-gamers. In dream case we would love to expand the project to games like League of Legends or Counter Strike.
